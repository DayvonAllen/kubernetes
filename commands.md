## Command
- `minikube start` - start a kubernetes cluster in development.
- `minikube stop`
- `minikube ip` - get minikube's IP address.
- `eval $(minikube docker-env)` - allows you to configure docker to point to minikube's docker containers instead of your local docker containers
- `kubectl` - allows you to interact with nodes(virtual machines) in your cluster.
- `kubectl apply -f <path and filename>` - feed a config file to `kubectl`. `-f` means you want to specify a file. `apply` means we want to change the configuration of our cluster.
  - `kubectl apply -f k8s` - if you have a "k8s" folder it will apply all the configuration that is specified in there.
  - `kubectl apply -f ./myconfig-pod.yaml` - individual config.
- `kubectl get pods` - prints the status of all running pods. `get` means we want to retrieve information about a running object.
  - `kubectl get services`
  - `kubectl get deployments`
  - `kubectl get storageclass` - gets all the options that kubernetes has for creating a persistent volume.
    - The standard option(default) is by making a slice of space on the hard drive that kubernetes is running on.
    - You can change that configuration
    - If you are using Google Cloud, `Google Cloud Persistent Disk` will be used to store data for persistent volumes by default.
    - If you are using AWS, `AWS Block Store` will be used to store data for persistent volumes by default.
  - `kubectl get pv` - gets all persistent volumes.
  - `kubectl get pvc` - gets all persistent volume claims.
  - `kubectl get secrets`
- `kubectl describe <type> <name>` - get detailed info about an object
- `kubectl delete -f <path to config file>` - delete object.
  - `kubectl delete pod <pod name>`
  - `kubectl delete service <service name>`
  - `kubectl deployment pod <pod name>`
- `kubectl set <property> <object_type>/<object_name> <container_name>=<new image to use>` - imperative command to update a property.
  - `kubectl set image <object_type>/<object_name> <container_name>=<new image to use>` - imperative command to update an image.
- `kubectl <docker-command...> <pod name>` - you can run certain docker commands using kubectl for its pods that it controls.
  - `kubectl exec -it client-pod --  bash`
  - `kubectl logs client-pod`
- `kubectl create secret generic <secret_name(can reference later in pod config)> --from-literal key=value` - creates a secret
